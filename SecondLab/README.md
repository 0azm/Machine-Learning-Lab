# Part 1: Dataset Selection  
•	Dataset Used: Titanic Passenger Data (OpenML/Kaggle).  
•	Format: CSV file containing 891 records and 12 features.  
# Data Source
* **Training Dataset:** [train.csv](./SecondLab/train.csv)
# Part 2: Problem Definition  
•	Problem Type: This is a Supervised Learning task.  
•	Machine Learning Task: Classification.  
•	Target Variable: The target is the Survived column (categorical: 0 = No, 1 = Yes).  
•	Objective: The model is expected to learn patterns from passenger data (such as Age, Sex, and Pclass) to predict whether a passenger survived the disaster.  
# Part 3: Data Inspection Summary  
•	Dimensions: The dataset consists of 891 rows and 12 columns.  
•	Features: Data types include a mix of integers (PassengerId, Pclass), floats (Age, Fare), and objects/strings (Name, Sex).  
•	Methodology: Data was loaded and inspected using the Pandas library in a Jupyter Notebook environment.  
# Part 4: Machine Learning Methodology Diagram  
•	Included below is the visual workflow of the project, from data selection to model evaluation.
